Achievements:
Throughout the development of my RPG game, I've reached several significant milestones. Here are some key accomplishments:

Implementation of Game Mechanics: Successfully integrated core game mechanics such as player movement, combat system, enemy AI, skill system, and item purchasing.

Multiplayer Mode Support: Developed robust multiplayer functionality allowing seamless cooperation between two players.

Variety of Monsters: Designed and incorporated multiple types of monsters with distinct behaviors and attack patterns to enhance gameplay diversity.

Skill Unlocking System: Implemented a skill progression system where players gradually unlock new abilities as they progress through the game.
Resource Management: Established a balanced in-game economy where players earn coins by defeating monsters, used to purchase health potions, upgrade skills, and enhance attack power.

User Interface Design: Created an intuitive user interface with clear navigation options, including the choice between single-player and multiplayer modes.
Game Highlights:
Dynamic Combat: Engage in fast-paced and dynamic combat encounters with various monsters, each requiring different strategies to defeat.

Strategic Skill Usage: Utilize a combination of basic skills (slash, kick, sliding) and unlockable abilities (fire generation, bullet shooting) strategically to overcome challenges.

Cooperative Gameplay: Team up with a friend in multiplayer mode to tackle enemies together, coordinating attacks and supporting each other in battle.

Resource Management: Manage resources effectively by balancing coin expenditure between purchasing items and upgrading skills to optimize character performance.
Key Events and Interactions:
Movement: Players navigate the game world using designated movement keys (W, A, S, D for Player One, arrow keys for Player Two).

Combat Actions: Players execute combat actions by pressing corresponding keys for slash, kick, and sliding attacks (J, K, L for Player One; 1, 2, 3 for Player Two).

Skill Usage: After unlocking skills, players can activate them using assigned keys (U, I for Player One; 4, 5 for Player Two) to generate flames or shoot bullets.

Item Purchasing: Players can purchase health potions by pressing the designated key (N) and upgrade skills or increase attack power using the assigned key (M).
