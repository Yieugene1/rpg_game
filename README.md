 Throughout the development of my RPG game, I've reached several significant
 milestones. Here are some key accomplishments:
 Implementation of Game Mechanics: Successfully integrated core game mechanics
 such as player movement, combat system, enemy AI, skill system, and item
 purchasing.
 Multiplayer Mode Support: Developed robust multiplayer functionality allowing
 seamless cooperation between two players.
 Variety of Monsters: Designed and incorporated multiple types of monsters with
 distinct behaviors and attack patterns to enhance gameplay diversity.
 Skill Unlocking System: Implemented a skill progression system where players
 gradually unlock new abilities as they progress through the game.
Resource Management: Established a balanced in-game economy where players earn
 coins by defeating monsters, used to purchase health potions, upgrade skills, and
 enhance attack power.
 User Interface Design: Created an intuitive user interface with clear navigation
 options, including the choice between single-player and multiplayer modes.
 GameHighlights:
 Dynamic Combat: Engage in fast-paced and dynamic combat encounters with various
 monsters, each requiring different strategies to defeat.
 Strategic Skill Usage: Utilize a combination of basic skills (slash, kick, sliding) and
 unlockable abilities (fire generation, bullet shooting) strategically to overcome
 challenges.
 Cooperative Gameplay: Team up with a friend in multiplayer mode to tackle enemies
 together, coordinating attacks and supporting each other in battle.
 Resource Management: Manage resources effectively by balancing coin expenditure
 between purchasing items and upgrading skills to optimize character performance.
 Key Events and Interactions:
 Movement: Players navigate the game world using designated movement keys (W, A,
 S, D for Player One, arrow keys for Player Two).
 Combat Actions: Players execute combat actions by pressing corresponding keys for
 slash, kick, and sliding attacks (J, K, L for Player One; 1, 2, 3 for Player Two).
 Skill Usage: After unlocking skills, players can activate them using assigned keys (U,
 I for Player One; 4, 5 for Player Two) to generate flames or shoot bullets.
 Item Purchasing: Players can purchase health potions by pressing the designated key
 (N) and upgrade skills or increase attack power using the assigned key (M)
